## Testing Filament Durometer
Print the test coupon with solid (100%) infil using the middle range of the manufacturer's recommended print settings (bed temperature, extruder temperature, print speed, etc). Use a smooth print bed (not textured).

Let the test coupon cool to room temperature (1 hour)

Use a durometer tester to measure the bottom (print bed) side of the test coupon. Take readings in multiple locations around the center of the coupon and record the average value.
